  * The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of the locality.
The possible values are:

* 'ROUND_ROBIN': This is a simple policy in which each healthy backend
                 is selected in round robin order.

* 'LEAST_REQUEST': An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy
                   hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests.

* 'RING_HASH': The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
               hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
               addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects
               1/N of the requests.

* 'RANDOM': The load balancer selects a random healthy host.

* 'ORIGINAL_DESTINATION': Backend host is selected based on the client
                          connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened
                          to the same address as the destination address of
                          the incoming connection before the connection
                          was redirected to the load balancer.

* 'MAGLEV': used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer.
            Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup
            build times and host selection times. For more information about
            Maglev, refer to https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824
